          MOTON 1-way
        </h5>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Like the name might explain already, the 1-way is a single adjustable
          damper.It is the same quality mono tube damper system that you already
          know from our line-up.This kit also includes the 22mm shaft and 44mm
          piston and therefor perfectly useable for racing and street or
          trackdays. The 22mm shaft together with our new low friction seals are
          set for fast responses and good feedback during massive side load.
          This is the perfect answer for racers that are not allowed to run
          canisters/reservoirsin their classor for people that simply love the
          non-remote setup.

          The 3-Way adjustable Moton damper features 15 positions of high speed
          bump, 6 positions low speed bump and 15 positions of rebound
          adjustment. The low speed bump adjuster is located on top of the high
          speed bump adjuster and can be adjusted in dependably. The low speed
          bump adjuster is very effective in helping to control body roll while
          adding to turn in and is effective in controlling pitch and squat. The
          3-Way adjustable Moton damper is using, like the double adjustable
          damper, a unique blow off valve system in the canister to totally
          control curb stones and bumpy track conditions.

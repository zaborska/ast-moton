      After almost 15 years at KONI Piet left and started Aragosta Suspension.
      Originally, most of Aragostaâ€™s production was for motocross and GP racing
      bikes, two disciplines in which they became world leader.
      <br />
      Building upon this success, Aragosta expanded their product range to
      include most vehicles and were present at World Rally championships,
      Kartcross and Touring car events. Aragosta set records in the Paris-Dakar
      Rally, in both the T1 and T2 categories.
      <br />
      After 6 years at Aragosta, 1986, Piet moved on to WP. At WP Piet worked on
      motorcycle suspension and front forks, together with Benny Wilbers, for
      over 3 years.
